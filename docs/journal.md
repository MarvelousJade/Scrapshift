## 2026-10-10 - Foundation

**Request:** Build a small polished Brotato-inspired Unity game that works with AssetScope. The user requested strong interview documentation, real bug records and incremental Git commits.

**Inspected:** Installed Unity 6000.6.5f1 and Windows build support; AssetScope README, package manifest, scanner/index API and demo builder. Its current package is embedded separately to avoid changing the other active project.

**Implemented:** Project/package manifests, assembly boundaries, weapon/enemy data definitions and scene-independent run rules. Five one-minute waves, three upgrade choices and explicit title/playing/upgrade/paused/win/loss states.

**Not yet verified:** Unity compilation, gameplay, rendering, tests or player build. These are upcoming milestones, not completed evidence.
